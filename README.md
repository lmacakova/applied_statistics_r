# Applied Statistics - Assessment
## Lucia Macakova
This is my Assessment for the module Applied Statistics, as a student of Atlantic Technical University in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics. 

## The Purpose of Assessment:
* Describe the stochastic nature of real-world measurements.
* Source documentation to programmatically perform a statistical test.
* Select an appropriate statistical test to investigate a claim.
* Perform a statistical test on data.

## Content of repository:
- README.md
- problems.ipynb
- requirement.txt
- .gitignore   

## How to work with jupyter notebook problems.ipynb:
1. Clone the repository with:\
 bash
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/lmacakova/applied_statistics_r.git
 cd applied_statistics_r
 ```
2. Create a virtual environment:\
 bash
 ```
 python -m venv .venv
 ```
    # macOS/Linux
 ```
 ource .venv/bin/activate
 ```
    # Windows PowerShell
 ```
 .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
 ```
3. Install requirements:\
 bash
 ```
 pip install --upgrade pip
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
4. Open the notebook in VS Code or Visual Studio Code and select Python (applied) as the kernel.

# Problems: 
## Problem 1: Combinations and Simulation
The Lady Tasting Tea experiment[^1], when 10 cups of tea are used, 3 cups have milk added first, 7 cups have tea added first, and the cups are thoroughly shuffled so that they seemingly cannot be told apart. 

Tasks:
1. Calculating the probability of randomly selecting exactly the 3 cups with milk added first.
2. The simulation of the process 1,000 times to verify the results.

Solution: I counted the probability of choosing a certain number of cups with the hypergeometric formula[^2] and made a simulation of randomly choosing 3 cups from 10 in 1,000. I found the results of probability from the simulation fluctuating, so I increased the number of trials to 1,000,000 to reach the theoretical values of probability.

## Problem 2: Normal Distribution
Task:
1. Evaluating whether numpy.random.standard_normal() generates values from a true normal distribution[^3] by generating a sample of 100,000 values. 
2. Using scipy.stats.shapiro()[^4] to test whether the sample comes from a normal distribution.  
3. Creating a histogram[^5] of sample and overlaying the probability density function (PDF)[^6] of the standard normal distribution on the histogram.

Solutions: I generated a sample of 100,000 values and tested it with the Shapiro-Wilk test. I chose the Kolmogorov-Smirnov[^7] test to further prove the normal distribution of data. Then I created a histogram of data and described the characteristics of the normal distribution of the data.

## Problem 3: t-Tests
Tasks:
1. Comparing the resting heart rates of smokers and non-smokers from sets containing resting heart rates for a sample of patients, along with whether they smoke or not. Calculating the t-statistic[^8] based on the data set, using Python without scipy or statsmodels. 
2. Comparing it to the value given by scipy.stats. Explain your work and list any sources used.

Solution: First, I checked assumptions about samples, so the test could be done correctly. Then I calculated the t-statistic with Welch's method[^9], which can be applied when the variances of samples are not equal.

## Problem 4: Type I Error
Tasks: 
1. Generating three samples with 100 values each with numpy.random.standard_normal()
2. Performing one-way ANOVA[^10] on the three samples in 10,000 trials and counting whenever a type I error occurs.

Solution: I generated 3 samples with 100 values, performed the ANOVA test in a loop of 10,000 trials, and counted the probability of type I error. 

## Problem 5: Binomial Distribution
Tasks:
1. Explaining the binomial distribution[^12] to colleagues. Writing a note about it, using numpy and/or scipy to generate values, and explaining its properties. 
2. Use matplotlib to graphically enhance your explanations.

Solution: I describe the binomial distribution and simulate it using numpy.random.binomial. I explain the resemblances and differences between binomial and normal distributions and the reasons behind them.
